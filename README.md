# lfb

lfb (light file browser) is a terminal file browser. The whole program is a mess as of now. In the feature I will remove the need for external dependencies, tidy up the code, make an actual readme, add documentation, and change the name.

[WARNING] the source for this program is a mess, look at it at your own risk.

## Dependencies

There is one dependency being used right now.

To install it use

```
pip install click
```

## Executing

This program only works from the terminal.

to use run with

```
python3 lfb.py
```

Until I make the program installable, I have it aliased in my bashrc

```
alias lfb="~/Documents/lfb/lfb.py"
```
